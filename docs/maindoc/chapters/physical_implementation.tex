\chapter{Physical Implementation}
\section{Brief description}
\par The protocol was implemented in a client-server application written in C++14. At beginning the client logs to the server by sending the user and the password typed by the user. Then, if the authentication goes right, it can download the files stored in its own directory inside the server. To implement the protocol we used the feuatures provided by OpenSSL library, wich allows us to generate good pseudo-rando numbers, to encrypt files through symmetric encription, and to sign messages through public-key encryption. The OpenSSL library is written in C so we defined some wrapper classes in order to semplify the use of it. We also used some wrappers in order to semplify the communication between client and server.
